An expression may be enclosed by certain scopes.

The identity scope, '{' and '}', returns the enclosed expression by anonymous name.

The value scope, '(' and ')', returns the anonymous value of the enclosed expression(similar to a c++ rvalue).
It is syntactic sugur for accessing the literal "value" subname of the given name. For example:
	(foo)
is equivalent to:
	foo:value

The type scope, '<' and '>', returns the type of the enclosed expression.
It is syntactic sugar for accessing the literal "type" subname of the given name. For example:
	<bar>
is equivalent to:
	bar:type
