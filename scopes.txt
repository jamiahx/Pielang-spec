An expression may be enclosed by certain scopes.

The identity scope, '{' and '}', returns the enclosed expression by anonymous name.

The value scope, '(' and ')', returns the anonymous value of the enclosed expression(similar to a c++ rvalue).

The type scope, '<' and '>', establishes type using the enclosed expression.
