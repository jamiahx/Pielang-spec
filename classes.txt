Suppose we wish to globally declare a class of a pair of bools. We could use the following:
	{class pair_bool}
	:	type
		= 	{	bool:type first
			;	bool:type second
			} 	
			:	type
However, this looks weird and contains a lot of boilerplate; thus we are afforded the <> syntactic sugar:
	<class pair_bool> 
	= 	<	<bool> first
		;	<bool> second
		>
