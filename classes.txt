The "class" class is the class of all classes, aka the universe class, and is in the global namespace.

The type of all classes is the "class" class and the parent classes/interfaces (inheritance).

Suppose we wish to declare a class of a pair of bools. We could use the following:
	pair_bool
	:=	{	type = { global:class; global:foo:pair }
		;	value
			= 	{	bool:value first
				;	bool:value second
				}:type
		}

However, this looks weird and contains a lot of boilerplate; thus we are afforded the <> syntactic sugar:
	(class & global:foo:pair)
	pair_bool 
	= 	<	(bool) first
		;	(bool) second
		>
